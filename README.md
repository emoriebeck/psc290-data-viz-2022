GitHub Repository for PSC290 - Data Visualization, UC Davis, Fall 2022

Welcome to the GitHub page for the psychology graduate-level course Data Visualization, taught by me (Emorie Beck) at UC Davis in Fall 2022. 

# Course Description**

In scholarly writing, a figure can be worth 1000 words. Data visualization is a key part of the scientific enterprise, yet most students are taught only a small range of visualizations that are most frequently used in their fields and for the types of methods they use. Such standard procedure can limit the reach and scope of scientific work in an era of rapid digital technological innovation. This course will be designed around themes rather than types of visualization. The beginning of the course will cover best practices in data visualization from the perspective of a growing literature on cognitive perceptions of data visualization and will orient students to visualizing data in R using ggplot2. Next, we will cover several broad topic areas, including visualizing probability, differences, and uncertainty. We will conclude with interactive and animated graphics in R and Shiny. Students are highly encouraged to bring their own data from ongoing or completed projects, but this is not required. 

# Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
1. Understand the cognitive and psychological underpinnings of perceiving data visualization. 
2. Identify good data visualizations and describe what makes them good. 
3. Produce data visualizations according to types of questions, data, and more, with a particular emphasis on building a toolbox that you can carry into your own research.

# Course Materials 

There is no official textbook for this course (but if there was, it’d be Claus Wilke’s book which we’ll draw from heavily). However, many of you are coming in with different levels of knowledge and different types of questions, so I am providing some suggested readings below.

**Beginner**: If you have little knowledge of the R programming language (e.g., you are typically given example scripts that you do basic modifications to and struggle with debugging), parts of this course may be difficult for you. I suggest familiarizing yourself with the following (free) ebooks:

Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  
Hadley Wickham: [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/). 

**Advanced**: If you have more knowledge of the R programming language, then I encourage you to use this course to think about how you program and to talk with me about typical challenges you have. For example, if you run dozens or hundreds of models and are typing all these out separately, there are solutions that are much less prone to human error.

**Everyone**: We will read a variety of books and articles throughout this course. One of the most frequent we will read excerpts from is below. Other readings will be updated throughout the course on the weekly descriptions below.

Claus Wilke: Fundamentals of [Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/).  

Kieran Healy, [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](http://socviz.co/).
