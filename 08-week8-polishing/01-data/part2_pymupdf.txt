LETTERS FROM JENNY (continued)

1929 (continued)
N.Y.C. Sunday 11/29
My dearest Boy and Girl:
This is not a regular letter, but even if it
were I could never begin to express my
gratitude to you. I believe that when two
persons really love each other in the highest
and best sense of the word, they are never
able to express their real feeling in words.
It must be something felt—believed—under-
stood. That's all.
Tomorrow, or next day, I shall tell you
of the happenings here. 
I have been quite
busy and will explain why, and how. In the
between times I try to realize what has hap-
pened. 
It is difficult to realize—Ross stood
here in my room so very well only a few
days ago—it is very wonderful.
Last night when coming home from the
Bronx where I went to move Ross's things,
and feeling very sad, my eye fell on an
evening paper "Princeton 10—Yale 6." In a
moment my heart was in my mouth. How
glad Ross would have been—how lovely for
our beloved College to win again. 
Only
i year ago yesterday Ross drove me to New
Haven to the game. 
Everything came our
way on that day—we surely were happy,
and one if ever a mother and son were one.
When coming home I said to Ross that even
if we were never again to have a happy day
together we could at least delight in the joy
of having had one; and Ross said "Yes, it
has been a perfect day—if we live to be a
hundred we can never have a happier day."
He did not know the chip then.
I have something interesting to tell you
about the chip—she is surely some chip.
Mr. Barter is a great help and comfort
to me. 
The administration papers were
signed yesterday.
My best love—sincere and true to you
both. Always as of yore.
Lady M.
N.Y.C. Nov. 25/29
My dearest and Best:
After a while I shall count up all my
riches—after the horror of this loss becomes
blunted a bit—you know "the years roll by
and on their wings bear healing"—wounds
do not remain open for always—and then
I shall count up my riches—such wonderful
friends—such friends—the glory of the sun
and the stars—the sigh of the sea—the
laughter of little children. Oh no, I shall
not do as my sister Betty does, sit for 24
hours a day counting the tick of the clock,
wishing to go. 
If ever I want to go that
badly I shall go.
Lady M.
N.Y.C. Dec. 2/29
My dearest and Best:
My affairs. Oh, they are all in a turmoil.
The chip lady altho' all dissolved in tears,
and of course heartbroken, is not too liquid
to forget that material things count in this
mundane sphere, and lo! she claimed Ross's
clothes, and Ross's car, and Ross's name, and
it's really funny (I have had to laugh more
than once) to hear that old D—f of an uncle
of hers call her "Mrs. Masterson Jr." 
She
could not make Ross (poor foolish Ross)
marry her while he was alive, and so she
wants to marry him now. he is dead. Mr.
Barter made out administration papers for
me and I signed them, when lo! the old
uncle came along and protested. He claims
that the chip as Ross's common law wije is
his nearest relative. I insist we must fight
that in the court if need be, for if Ross
wanted to marry her he could have done so
in May when she became his mistress, or at
any time since, but time and again he an'd I
have quarreled about it, and he insisted that
while she was an all-right mistress he did
not want her for a wife. It is certainly new
for her to care anything at all about her
449

ANONYMOUS
reputation—too bad she didn't care sooner.
However all that keeps us back and we may
possibly have a law-suit. 
If she is Ross's
nearest relative it is she who will receive that
Vet's compensation, and that would be tragic
enough to make one die of laughter. 
She
has only known him 6 mos. February was
the beginning of their "great Romance"—
dirty and low as they are made—the low
contemptible street dog. 
She killed Ross—
morally and physically. 
J,
N.Y.C. Sunday 12/8/29
My dear Boy:
No—do not write to the Chip—it would
never do. You see, Mr. Barter and I quite
ignore her claims, we say she hasn't any.
To ask her not to take legal action against
me, or to withdraw any action she may have
taken, is simply out of the question. 
She
will probably think twice before entering a
suit against me.
Well, we found the nigger, it's the com-
pensation, and the car. 
They won't get
either if I can prevent it. 
The chip flung
2 or 3 fits—beat the air—beat her head with
her hands, and screamed. 
She killed Ross
all right—she beat his head when he told
her about going to Chicago—and she killed
him. 
Lady M.
N.Y.C. Dec. 12/29
My dearest Boy:
We are now launched on the law-suit.
Ross left his Vet. Comp'n to his "estate"—
I refused to sign the paper acknowledging
the Chip in any way. It is now up to her
to take action against me for swearing that
I am Ross's nearest relative. Wonder if she
will dare!
Best love to all. 
Lady M.
N.Y.C. Wednesday 12/18/29
My dearest Boy and Girl:
Please ask Mr. Pratt to drop in and see me
if he comes home for Christmas; there's noth-
ing new to tell about the suit, except that
Mr. Barter has asked Washington (Veterans)
if they will waive administration papers con-
sidering that the estate is so very small. No
answer yet.
My sister will not come to N.Y. for Christ-
mas, so I have offered myself—my services—
to the United Charities, as waitress—sandwich
lady—or dish-washer—any old thing. I am
pretty late in offering, but Betty delayed me.
My best love to you all. 
Lady M.

Glendonabel: Greetings:
I do hope I may be among the first to
wish you all a Happy New Year—you have
been in my thoughts a thousand times today.
Last New Year Ross and I stood on Times
Square to laugh at a crowd of young men
—very much jagged—who insisted on stop-
ping traffic so they might shake hands with
the traffic cop and tell him what a fine fellow
he was. Everyone was delighted, and we all
cheered for the Police. Today I went to a
caffeteria for 20 cents worth of vegetables,
and have not spoken two words to a blessed
soul all day. Ross wasn't always wise (who
is?) but he had only one big failing, and
many of us have more than one. Had he
remained with us he would, in time, have
been all right. Poor Ross. 
Lady M.
N.Y.C. Jan. 28/30
My dearest Girl:
The fur reached me on Saturday and I
am delighted with it. It is quite lovely. Now
with my decent coat—it has very good lines
—I, at least, am to the naked eye a very
respectable, decent lady. 
Perhaps if some
seer could peep into my heart and see the
quantity of resentment and hate stored there
he might forget about the fur and the
Franklin Simon lines of my coat and class
me with quite another group than the decent
and respectable.
Feb. 18/30
My dearest and best:
The car is gone at last—my heart ached
to see a strange man slip into Ross's seat
and drive away. My poor foolish Ross—my
Baby.
LETTERS FROM JENNY
That car made me sweat blood. The chip
tried to persuade the garage man to give
it to her, and when he refused to accept
money covering the rent, $38, from her, she
threw the money upon the table and went
away—he still has the money. 
It was the
new number plates that made my heart drop
into my shoes—they cost 13.50. 
Well, it's
over now—
"All things end," you know
"Only art remains to us,
The bust outlives the throne,
The coin, Tiberius."
Mr. B. says the car flew like a bird out
to Queens, his home, and never a hitch.
Ross loved the car. We had a perfect day
when we drove to the game. A lovely day
—we were happy together—Ross and I.
We find, apparently by chance, that the
Chip is booked for France—intends to sail
on March 4, leaves her N.Y. job end of this
mo. 
She has first tied up the payment of
the money, in the Veteran's Bureau in Wash-
ington. That's her little "dog-in-the-manger"
game, you see.
There is always the possibility—indeed
probability—that I may drop dead, or be
worried to death, or starve to death (she
has never heard of that Canadian money—
neither did Ross, thank Heaven) and one
can't live for ever on air.
Well, she may sail, but like the Scotchman
"I hae me doots"—I'm thinking she won't
sail—we have been entirely too easy with
her. 
Now I show my fangs, and I intend
to use them and teach this contemptible
she-dog a lesson. 
Lady M.
Feb. 24/30
My dearest and Best:
At the present moment I am holding my
breath and shivering in my shoes—all nerves
—waiting to hear from Mr. Barter that he
has served a court notice on the woman
forbidding her to leave the jurisdiction of
the N.Y. courts until our case is settled. I
am fearing to be impatient, yet full of
anxiety—but if I do not hear from Mr.
Barter within the next day or so, I shall go
down and find out definitely where we stand.
Lady M.
Feb. 27/30
My dearest Isabel:
. . . My Social Service lady and I have
about come to the parting of the ways—I
certainly don't like the Social Svc. ladies.
They are evidently out to straighten up all
the tangles in the lives of all of us igno-
rant mortals, and I just can't stand them.
How this damn bunch ever came to be so
wonderful as they think they are is a mystery
to me. 
I suppose that constantly dealing
with the down and out ignorant class they
jump to the conclusion that they themselves
are superior, and truly it "gets my goat."
They just can't get away from their job. So
I'm pretty well alone in my Eagle's Nest
again, and I'm glad.
Feb. 27/30
My dear:
I really wanted to see you very badly—
I wanted to "talk law"—did you say "Thank
Heaven you were out"? It's this way—when
away from my lawyer Mr. Barter I lose faith
in him—he seems to play into the hands of
my enemy—to leave undone the things which
he ought to have done, etc.
Last week—last wee\ mind you, I received
a letter from him in which he said "You
will be interested to know that Miss Volt
wrote me a very few days after Ross's death
stating in said letter that she realized that
her legal position was hopeless."
When Mr. B. shook hands with me I
hated him—I did not intend to offer him
my hand. 
He offered his, and I took it,
hating myself for doing it. 
And then he
talked to me—he is such a straightforward,
honorable gentleman, anyone should see at
a glance that he is a gentleman. And then
I was ashamed—ashamed to have doubted
him—I don't understand why he does the
things he certainly does do, but I can't believe
him to be a scoundrel or a double dealer.
You have my best wishes, and 
best
thoughts. 
Lady M.
March 6/30
My dearest:
This is the first day since last week
(Wednesday) that I have been able to use
452
ANONYMOUS
my lips in either speaking or eating with-
out having them bleed. 
You can imagine
my high fever—deep cracks in my parched
lips. I was this way once before when in
the Orphanage and we had that scrap about
their cruelty to the children. Now "Richard
is himself again"—have been sleeping 8 and
10 hours every night, and every time I
happen to sit down, either at home, in the
train—anywhere.
I am always thinking "Nobody can injure
Ross now—Ross is safe, and is all mine as
of yore—I don't have to share him with
anybody."
Dear Glenn, help me to be fair and just
to Mr. Barter—point out to me where I was
wrong, if I were indeed wrong. I do not
forget that Mr. Barter came to me at the
Hospital when the Chip had me put out,
and that thro" his coming the Hospital
apologised to me, and that I was with Ross
until the very last. 
No, I don't forget
that. . . .
Lady M.
March 26/30
My Dearest:
It's only 4 a.m. but I can't stand that bed
another minute—am all nerves—wide awake,
and mad as a wet hen. Thank Heaven I still
have you—what could I ever do without you?
It's all that Barter man—that boob, block-
head—ass. 
You remember the Bond Co.
wrote me re their joint control of Ross's
money? Well, I went to my banker and he
advised me to get a decent lawyer to take it
up with the Bond Co. I did. On explaining
the case to the lawyer he squeezed up his
eyes and stared at me—he said "So you really
had no case, it was never in the Courts?"
"No." 
He said "You are not 27—are you?"
"No," I said, "nor a chip—I am not a chip."
There were several heavy law books on the
desk, and he shoved them so hard that they
fell with a thud on the floor. He said "It's
a damn shame."
As a result of all this I went to the Bond
Co. and hunted up the writer of the letter
to me. The man just took the file covering
my case, which contained several letters from
Barter, and wrote "Closed" across the face
of it. We then shook hands, and he advised
me to go home and sleep and forget it, that
I was free from the Bond, and he hoped
from lawyers and my other persecutors.
Now it's 20 past 5 and I feel a lot better—
you are a help and comfort to me, more than
I can ever express. All those terrible years
you have stood by me—helped me in every
way—no, the world is not so bad.
Lady M.
April 11/30
My dearest Girl:
If my present plans pan out I shall spend
Easter with my sister Betty in Montreal. She
urges me to go. I believe she will be glad
to see me—for once in her life. Well, Betty
and I were never very close—never fond of
me. 
She is and has always been strictly
orthodox in everything. I am not orthodox
at all. To sit opposite each other at 3 meals
every day for 365 days holds no joy for me.
Nor for her. I must live alone—alone with
my dreams—my wasted life—my wreckage.
We can be within call when needed, that's
the most I hope for.
Then Betty must have money—she lives
on her own property, a very nice place, and
she probably has cash enough to keep it up.
She says she is merely living "from day to
day" and doesn't yet know just how she
stands financially, but that is what our
friend Gov. Smith would call "baloney." She
just doesn't want to tell me. 
But maybe
she will want to, after a while. In the mean-
time I must keep enough to place me in a
"Home."
Tell dear Glenn I haven't heard from the
Barter man, and if he writes to Glenn regard-
ing me, not to tell him anything, until after
I am safely under King George's care.
Lady M.
Montreal, Can. April 24/30
My dearest and Best:
This is merely to say that I have arrived
safely, and am now under the protection of
H.R.H. the King. My coming has been try-
ing—full of tears, heart-aches, and welcomes
home. Everyone is kind as kind can be.
LETTERS FROM JENNY
453
When an elderly, grey haired, sad woman
with an old and wrinkled face, and stooped
shoulders opened our door, my heart sank,
for I thought she was the maid and I felt
that Betty, my sister, should have come to
welcome me; but when the lady took me in
her arms and kissed me I knew that she was
Betty, 
I was shocked beyond expression—
had I met her on the street I could never
have guessed who she was. It is very sad.
We have had a constant stream of visitors
since Sunday—men and women we knew
when we were all young together. On Sun-
day our house looked like a Florist's Shop—
the very loveliest 
flowers. 
Everyone is
wonderful.
My best and most sincere love to all three.
Lady M.
Canada May 7/30
My dearest Girl:
. . . She is essentially the same old Betty
that she was "when Jenny was a girl," and
she drew her skirts aside (literally) so not
to suffer polution thro' touching me. 
Just
the same. Her grief has made her old, and
stooped, and broken, but her grief is all
for herself. 
She misses attentions she has
always had.
What gets me is that no one else in all
the world has ever known defeat, disappoint-
ment, or grief. As for mel I'm just not in it
at all. What can / matter—who am I? My
heart aches when I look at her, she is so
broken—but I've got to go out and tramp
it off. She never leaves the house—It's nearly
two years now.
Lady M.
Canada June 8/30
My dearest Girl:
I have been quite upset, and ill, since
coming here, and was, for several days, on
the fence about going back. Such a move,
however, seemed premature, and so I decided
to try the thing out, and rented this apart-
ment. 
It was a very lucky move—I feel
much better already, and am not nearly so
nervous. (I'll soon be able to grab my pen
properly.) 
The little excitement and diver-
sion of fixing up my little place was better
for me than medicine. 
Donald's picture
smiles at me every day—Ross is on the wall
—his pipes and tobacco pouch where I can
handle them often—his lounging robe in my
closet—it's almost a home. My own books,
Adrigoole, and Messer Marco Polo, with
Ross's prizes, and our gifts to each other,
all those things which I love, and are part
of me—all here close to my big chair, and
me—it's fine.
All my love to you, as of yore, dear
Glendonabel.
Lady M.
Sunday. June 15/30
My Dearest and Best:
I had my furniture shipped here—Betty
said she would not allow me to have it in
her house. So I rented a place of my own,
and am now sitting on my own bench, and
writing on my own table. And Ross's photo
is on the wall, and Donald's on my dresser,
and when I cant sleep I get up and make
myself a cup of tea, and it's no one's business.
It's fine. Oh, no, we didn't fight—I go to
visit her now and then—it's much the better
way. Oil and water just won't mix.
After getting the papers and picturing that
infernal devil leaving Ross's dying bed and
rushing to the Bank, twice in one day, to
draw his money; and I being such an ass
to permit her to attend the funeral, or to
show her any mercy at all; and then the
move—and my grief about Betty, and not
knowing what to do—whether to go, or stay
—well, my nerves gave out, and lol I lost
my speech for two days. One day I couldn't
make a sound at all, but the next day I was
able to whisper. 
Am ok again now. 
Just
fancy my not being able to speak—truly it
must have been some upset to bring about
such a state of affairs.
Lady M.
Canada, June 17/30
My dearest Boy:
. . . Poor Ross's ashes:—will you please
thank Mr. Pratt in your nicest way for me.
I may ask him to do as you so kindly sug-
gest—altho' I would rather force the under-
taker to carry out my instructions. It was
454
ANONYMOUS
very thoughtful of you to communicate with
the express people. 
I, too, have been to
them and they claim that so far as they are
concerned the ashes can come through at
any time. So I intend to make a statement
absolving the undertaker from all responsi-
bility—and have a Notary seal it; then I
shall send it with an order to express the
ashes. 
Will let you know the result.
My condition, mental and physical—you
are right, my dear, I am a lot better now.
Leaving the tony house has lifted a burden
from my soul. Truly "Stone walls do not a
prison make." I am peculiarly susceptible to
"atmosphere"—and having to pass my sister's
bedroom door and know that she was locked
in with her bottle (bottles) to take, like
Mrs. Gamp, "a little when she felt disposed,"
made my heart behave something terrible—
galloping and jumping in my "innards"—
Instead of rushing back to Uncle Sam as
I felt sorely tempted to do, I have decided
to remain here until autumn, and by that
time have made my plans definitely.
Lady M.
Monday July 9/30
My dearest and Best:
You should be glad to have only one great
day when you all go "Bang." 
We have
Queen Victoria's Day—the day of the King,
the Queen, Prince of Wales, Prince George
—Orange—Men's 
Day—Mason's 
Day—St.
Patrick's Day, and the Lord only knows
what others—oh! Dominion Day was July i.
Geel But we don't celebrate by going "Bang"
—we close all houses, business and otherwise,
and go dead—one could not buy a news-
paper, a pint of milk, or a loaf of bread
to save one's life. We take our enjoyments
sadly.
I am dying to unfold my great and per-
manent plans to you, but can't do it until
those other things are cleared up.
Best love,
Lady M.
Canada July 27/30
My dearest and Best:
Everything is all right now—thanks to
you, and thro' you to Mr. Pratt. The package
arrived yesterday (Saturday) and now Ross
is safe witfi his Mother again—nothing can
separate us now—Ross is safe. For the first
time in many months^-years—I am at peace.
Ross is safe. Last night I slept for 12 solid
hours, for the first time in many a moon,
and don't think I even turned in the bed.
Everything is all right. 
I can't be, or have
been, such a wicked person after all—God
is on my side.
I have been erring, and short-sighted, and
made bad moves on Life's checker board, but
I never deliberately planned to injure any-
one; when full of despair, and feeling that
God being disgusted with me had forsaken
me (by "God" I mean the Great Governing
Power, whatever it may be) then I remem-
bered that Isabel and you were by my side,
fond of me, helping me—that I was (and
am) dead certain of you, and so how could
I be so very wicked, how "forsaken"—was
I not protected and strong. 
And so your
friendship, and your love, buoyed me up, and
helped me to keep a hold on myself. Ross
is all mine now.
Canada August 1/30
My dearest Boy and Girl:
Since receiving that package I have ob-
tained a new lease of life—am sleeping like
a top—eating like a trooper, and am full of
plans for the future.
Well, the great plan:—Today being August
i, I paid my rent and gave notice—I shall
have shaken Canadian dust off my feet, and
said Farewell to King George before Sept. i.
The packing co. will take my goods to be
crated in about 3 weeks from now—they
already have the contract—I pay them before
I leave. 
The goods will be consigned to
the Storage Warehouses Inc. who will clear
the customs for me. 
After reaching New
York I shall leave my baggage (i trunk) in
the Depot. I shall then hunt a i rm. apart-
ment at $25 a month. It's a job, but can be
done. 
It must be clean, and on a decent
street—that's all. 
I can do it in the week
that it will take the R.R. to carry the furni-
ture. All I need is a bed, and my handbag,
in the meantime—the automats are still on
hand.
LETTERS FROM JENNY
455
I shall place the sum of $1000.00 in reserve
in a bank, and act as tho" I never had it.
There will be enough left to help me along.
If I live long enough (and the Gods forbid)
I shall enter a Home and give them the
money. 
If I don't live long enough it goes
to Isabel and you, and you will attend to my
affairs.
My love always. 
Lady M.
Canada. Aug. 10/30
My dearest Girl:
. . . Am anxious to settle somewhere at
last—am wondering if I am the Wandering
Jew re-incarnated—certainly I'm a wander-
ing something—but it can't last for ever—
"Even the weariest river flows somewhere
safe to sea."
I shall leave here in the last week of
August—will let you know date later so you
can watch the papers for a wreck—and then,
for a month, my only address will be General
Delivery, New York City. 
Please send me
your address.
I could not leave here if I were of the
slightest use, or comfort, to my sister, but
she has money, and many friends who are
much closer to her than I could ever be,
and she is in good health, so why stay?
I was absent too long to ever again seem
one of the family—people should keep in
close touch with their own.
Best love to Glendonabel,
Lady M.
Sunday. Aug. 24/30
My dearest and Best:
This is the last word I shall send to any-
one, from Canada. My trip to Canada has
not been wholly a failure, for had anyone
told me 6 mos. ago that my Sister Betty
had not been changed at all (except in out-
ward appearance) by that terrible accident,
I could never have believed it. Yet such is
the case; she is exactly as she always was—
selfish, vindictive, mean, self-centered. 
To
her, I have always been the lawless one, the
family disgrace, the black sheep who mar-
tied a divorced man. 
Such horrorl 
I am
still the same—in her sight.
Au revoir. 
Lady M.
New York City. Sunday. Sept. 7/30
My dearest Boy and Girl:
... I had no trouble at all in entering this
country—the Govt. man who questioned us
at the Bridge was extremely friendly, and
my madly beating heart settled down to
normal after an hour or so. I don't think
it ever occurred to him that I intended to
swell the list of the unemployed—I feel quite
sure that he mistook me for a "lady."
Go to the Sea for a few days if you can
and get away from the placing 'of furniture
and making plans. 
There's nothing, no
place, like the sea. 
I've been out twice.
Nothing else makes me feel their insignifi-
cance—the paltry troubles of living—the im-
mensity of space—the grandeur of God—the
strength and power of the Great Unknown.
My best love to both—"till all friendships
die."
Lady M.
New York City Oct. 23/30
My dearest Girl:
This month has been pretty hard on me—
I had to move—it cost a lot—then came
Ross's birthday, October 16. 
Last Oct. 16
Ross spent with me—I watched for him
all morning, my heart in my mouth. Then
early in the afternoon he came, carrying a
lovely bunch of red roses—my favorites—he
always got red roses for me. 
I was in
Heaven. 
He had not forgotten—he chose
to have dinner with me—not with the Chip.
He took me to a nice place up here on
Broadway, and then to a show—a splendid
show—he came to my room on the roof,
and kissed goodnight under the stars—how
little we dreamed of what the next year
would bring! I am always thinking of him
—always wishing that I had done something
I did not do—or left something undone, or
unsaid, that I did do, and said.
Lady M.
Dec. 30/30
My dearest Boy:
This is my "ways and means" letter, but
let it go until you have a spare hour to think
about it—if that happy condition ever occurs.

ANONYMOUS
If Betty dies before I do, which isn't at all
likely, I would probably get something worth
while, but that is too vague to build on. So
the question is, what to do with what I
actually possess now. To go on eating it up,
as I am now doing, I would soon be without
any. 
I won't do that. 
I do not want to
work. Why work—for whom, or what? To
work merely to keep on going, isn't worth it.
I don't want to keep on going. Anyway,
I've done my share.
So, my plan is to enter a Home—a "Home
for aged women." 
A Home for those who
are through, and are just waiting. On in-
quiry I find there are many such in, and
near, New York.

My dearest Girl:
. . . Not being a great lover of the new in
anything, I cannot bellow with much fervor
"Ring out the old, ring in the new"—it is
always a matter of deep regret with me to
have to give up the old; I love my old dress,
and coat, and wear them until they just
about fall off.
Well the New is on his way, anyway,
whether I like it or not. All things pass.
You have my best wishes and best love
for the New Year, and my deep gratitude
for the Old.
Sincerely,
Lady M.

My dearest Girl:
. . . So you see, my dear, I am not really
a subject to go out to tvorl^. To rush out
every day on the alarm of a clock, as I have
done for so many years, and combat the little
worries and vexations, which are bound to
occur in any sort of business, would soon
land me in a lunatic asylum. It's my mind
that is holding me together now—I love the
sunset over the Jersey hills beyond the Hud-
son—I love the hills and hollows of N.Y.,
love the sea (I go there often), love books—
often get away from myself—it's such a
rest—forget my terrible failures in life—my
agonies—
Well, all that sort of thing points to a
retreat of some sort—a "Home for Aged
Women." I'm not really so very old, and
it's almost a crime to shove myself in among
all those decrepit old souls I see in the
"Homes," but what else is there to do? And
one good point is that I have learned to live
alone. I can, and have, lived alone so long,
that it comes natural to me. I have never
mixed intimately with anyone except Ross—
have never had confidants until God sent
Glenn and you to me.
Lady M.
N.Y.C. Sunday. Feb. 8/31
My dearest Boy:
Sometimes I feel that Ross knows about
you and me, and is not far away, and that
he tries to help me. If he knows anything
now—anything of the days gone by—any-
thing of our heartaches and disappointments,
he must know that he made a number of
very grave mistakes, and is sorry for them.
You remember that last day he spent with
me, and I urged him to take my bank
account and go to Chicago, and begin all
over again (I told you about it at the time)
and I said that the summer months were the
most unhappy in my entire life, he got up
from his seat at the luncheon table, and
walked the floor, his lips white as death,
and said "Well, Mod, you had nothing on
me." He then went on to say that he knew
he had treated me "rotten," and he was
sorry, that many times, all summer, he had
rushed into excesses, trying to persuade him-
self that he was happy, but that he knew
all the time he was wrong. Maybe he knows
now—I must believe that in his soul he
loved me.
And so I have been hunting up a "Home."
If I become ill here, they will dump me into
a hospital, and that will eat up all my
money. I have been to see several "Homes,"
some quite lovely, some little more than a
Poor House where the women sleep in a
Dormitory. One, a very nice one, has a large
stone over the entrance, and cut in it "Home
for aged, respectable, indigent Females."
LETTERS FROM JENNY

Their booklet explains that the home was
built when there were only two classes of
women "Ladies and Females." 
Gee! No, I
couldn't bear to be one of the "indigent
females"—tho' it's a very nice home. I have
been out to several places in the suburbs,
but have decided not to go to the country.
I shall take my chances in N.Y.

My dearest Isabel:
... I am having a great time hunting up
a "Home"—a "Home for the aged." It's a
joke, for you know Isabel my dear, I am
not "aged" at all. 
Still I must live some-
where, or else take a trip to the roof, for
money has wings and flies away.
One place I called at, the poor old ladies
were all so decrepit and old that I was
ashamed to enquire about entrance for my-
self, and so pretended I was asking for an
"old lady friend."
There's a perfectly beautiful place out in
Rye, one of our very select suburbs—the place
is like a palace. 
I might get in there for
about 700 or 800 dollars, but it stands alone
up in the woods. They are too tony to have
a st. car line. The Home is 1/2 hours walk
from the Depot—beautiful auto roads but
no sidewalk—where in thunder could I go
for a walk? What a horror to find myself
at the R.R. Depot some evening in the dark?
To be shut up in that place for life like a
bird in a gilded cage—oh no!

My dears—Hello:
This is merely a gossip note—so many
wonderful things in our papers, and happen-
ing every day that I am fairly "bustin"' to
talk about them—but there's no one to say
a word to—alas!
. . . If you havent read "The Private Life
of Helen of Troy" by John Erskine, get it.
It is one of the cleverest things I've read in
an age—have just finished it.
After the Clubs, and several ladies, have
decided the present great question as to who
invented "Mother's Day" I sincerely hope
they may take that person out and shoot her
at sunrise—it was some woman, I suppose.
Love to Donald, and the rest of the
family—
Lady M.
N.Y.C. April 3/31
My Dears:
. . . No, I didn't know that the Florists
invented "Mother's Day"—our papers have
been fighting about it, and some lady in
Phila. has taken an action against some N.Y.
Woman's Club, over it. I read somewhere
that the Florists in convention deplored the
fact that they had no suitable ad. as flowers
apply to weddings and funerals, births, etc.
and one bright member said "Well, at that
rate we should tell them to Say it with
flowers no matter what—joy or sorrow." Of
course the florists make the money, just as
the several societies do who sell poppies. But
most things in America run to money.
All my love as of yore.

My dearest Boy and Girl:
It is quite imperative that I should make
some arrangement about my future. Appar-
ently I am doomed to keep on going until
Goodness knows when—maybe 20 years.
Heavens! Since taking to the milk and eggs
diet I have grown heavier, feel, and sleep
better. 
But alas! the milk and eggs cost
money, and a fortune like mine cannot last
long. Then what? The City (thro' the Red
Cross) has a Home downtown where they
shelter and serve one meal a day to 300 girls
—18 to 23—who are constantly hunting
employment. 
They are all "white collar"
girls. For me to try to compete with them
ANONYMOUS
would be worse than silly. 
I have never
been a servant—to start now to wash other
people's dishes, and cook, I refuse to do—
just to live from day to day wouldn't be
worth it. And, anyway, the "Homes" would
not consider my application at all had I ever
been a "Domestic." 
Domestics must go to
the Poorhouse, or Welfare Island. Not me.
So you see my dears I must do something,
and soon.

My Dearest:
Your indigent, tho' respectable, female
friend is nursing a fractured rib. About 2
weeks ago I was looking anxiously for a
letter from one of the Committee Dames,
and when noon came I turned in bed to see
if one was under my door; the maid slips
the early morning delivery under our doors.
Yes, there was a letter—now instead of turn-
ing out like a sensible person and stooping
to pick up my letter, I leaned over to reach
it; snap went my rib—I got out then all
right, but, like many of the "right" things
we do, it was done too late, to save my rib.
However, the pain, inconvenience, etc. have
compensations for being compelled to rest,
keep comparatively in the one position, etc.
it not only gave my rib a chance to adjust
itself but also rested my heart. 
My heart
has been pretty bad for several weeks.
The Indigent females Board meets on
Thursday next. 
After that I will probably
know what's going to become of me, and
it will be none too soon, for this "on the
fence" business plays the mischief with my
nerves.
Betty has written lately. She has not yet
moved back to her own house and garden,
the weather being bad. 
It is just possible
that she may ask me to go there. Her letter
may be just a feeler. She is like that.
I will let you know, soon as I know my-
self. 
To tell the truth I'm not struck on
getting up when I'm told, and eating when
I'm told, and having the light turned out
at 10. I go to bed about 2.30, and sleep
whenever I can. But—nothing lasts forever
—all things pass.
Lady M.
May 21/31
My Dearest:
I attended the Board Meeting about noon,
and while nothing is definitely settled, I have
reason to hope that they will admit me.
Their attitude was decidedly friendly and
kind. There were about a dozen ladies seated
around a large table in what is evidently the
Board Room. 
I fell in love with them all,
and whether they admit me or not I shall
always be glad to have met them. One lady
asked me questions and made notes of my
replies. 
She probably had some form to
fill in.
They had, on the table, your letter, one
from Miss Groves, and one from Mr. Pratt.
They said that no one could be more highly
recommended. 
They asked for my church
connection, but I doubt if my lack there
will be a serious obstacle. They asked for
my family physician. None? 
Do I mean
I have no Dr.? 
I look delicate, why not
have a Dr., am I a C.S.? 
Would I object
to have a Dr. in case of sickness, should
they admit me to the Home? 
Would I
undergo an examination by their Dr. before
being admitted? Do I incline to C.S.? Then
we all laughed, for I certainly don't. Mrs.
Eddy is not, and never has been, on my list
of friends. If I must change to something
else, I would much prefer Buddha. I think
that my looking pretty delicate and not hav-
ing had a Dr. puzzled them. But I wanted
to impress them with the fact that I am
not an invalid, and have no organic disease.
They object to sick, or ailing persons. 
I
didnt say a word about my fractured rib.
Well, of course I may never hear from
them again, but anyway they are awfully
nice.
Best love,
Lady M.
May 31/31
My dearest Boy and Girl:
. . . Well, now my news! It is all settled—
I have been accepted by the Board—passed
the Dr.'s examination, and been assigned a
room. 
The room is being renovated, and
will be ready inside of 2 weeks. 
I shall
furnish it myself. 
It is fine—I am very

satisfied, and very grateful. The Board was
all lovely to me—the nicest ladies I've met
in many a day. 
They permit me to take
in all my own things, altho' that is against
the rules. 
So I have bought a nice new
Windsor bed, springs, and mattress, sent
blankets etc. to the cleaners, and so I shall
be clean anyway. They re-paint my room.
1 have been quite ill over it, but will soon
settle down and will then give you more
details.

My dearest Girl:
The great step has been taken, and I am
now here for better or worse—it's like
getting married. 
I feel no doubt in the
world but the step is decidedly for "better"
and is the. wisest and most sensible step I
have taken in many a day.
The house is very large—takes in a block
—about 150 "guests," and it seems to me,
servants everywhere. I never expected to find
so many servants. And they are all young—
praise be. 
We have a General Supt.—an
Asst. Supt., a housekeeper, several cooks, and
kitchen help, several young girl waitresses,
2 men for elevator—a door-man. The meals
are fine—white linen—so white—and by the
way we have our own laundry, and are
allowed 16 pieces a week. 
Isn't that fine.
Hottest water ever was, all the time—and
the house is perfectly clean. It is like a good
hotel.
Already I have a protege—a blind woman.
She was head of the advertising Dept. I sit
near her at table, cut up her food, watch
her, and already we are friends. She comes
to my room every afternoon and likes to sit
in Ross's chair.. She feels the books, and is
familiar with them.
I hope it won't be very long before I have
the pleasure of a visit from you. This house
is convenient to everywhere, easy to get at.
You have all my best thoughts, and love.
Lady M.

My dearest Boy and Girl:
... I will write later and give particulars
as to what things I had to sign over to this

I am feeling wonderfully well. This is the
best move I have ever made.

My dearest Girl:
My dear, my going to visit you this year
does not depend on any "plans" of mine.
At the present moment I can't eat solid food,
not having teeth, and speak with difficulty.
The hole in my mouth is something awful—
like a great cavern, my tongue doesn't half
fill it. Well, it will be another month before
my "store teeth" are ready, and then good-
ness only knows how it will be. 
Surely I
would love to go. Donald and I should have
met and been friends long ago, but Fate
ordains those things, and who can fight
Fate? My sight is very poor—frightens me,
and soon as I have teeth and can speak, I
shall go to a good oculist and get fixed up.
It takes money to do those things, but there
is no way to avoid it. 
Of course we have
a number of clinics and such, but not for me.
I must have the best for such very important
work. 
Lady M.

My dearest Boy:
. . . My Dentist and I have had a scrap—
the job was to be $100. I paid 50. Before
going to Canada last year this same man
had placed two bridges for me—fioo. but
when I got to Canada one of them hurt so
dreadfully that I couldnt eat anything, so I
got a Canadian to remove it—another $25.
Then the 50 paid in June on account, which
means $200, and at the heel of the hunt
I had nothing at all to show for the money.
So I made him return $25 of the last 50,
letting him keep 25 for extraction, which I
consider a liberal arrangement. 
There are
still roots which must come out. I lost faith
in him, so it was best to part. One can find
common ordinary people anywhere.
The "Home" arrangement is panning out
pretty well, I am glad to be here. There's
a feeling of security and finality about it that
is very restful. A feeling that nothing more
460

can possibly happen. My room is very com-
fortable, the food good enough, the house
delightfully open, airy and clean, and what
more can one want? I have as much privacy
as I have ever had, and we are free to come
and go as we please. 
Lady M.
N.Y.C. Sept. 16/31
My dearest Girl:
. . . You would be interested to meet our
bunch here—I find that more than half of
our women are "maids" and many of them
school teachers, some drawing pensions—
75 and 95 monthly. One "miss" has a slim,
young figure, but her face! 
Such a thin
narrow nose, and her mouth is exactly like
a horseshoe turned upside down—and altho
here a very short time she has a lot to say,
a self-opinionated impudent creature. When
she came first I made overtures, but soon
drew back. I dont want to know her.
There's a little old music teacher—used to
play the organ in a Brooklyn Church—some-
thing fell on her after she entered this house
and broke her bac\. She is quite stooped
over—her chin almost resting on her knees—
it is very pitiful. It is funny how many of
them try to "put it on"—one old one told me
that her husband was a "Railroad man." She
didn't say whether a President, or a porter.
Another said her husband was "in the City
Hall" in Phila. for many years, and that he
wore a tall hat. He may have been Mayor,
or a white-wings—the latter wear tall hats-
on the Labor Day parade.
But I am very grateful to Fate for placing
me here—no rent—food enough—laundry—
good bath and plenty of hot water—oceans
of it—what more can I need. Entire privacy
and every evening I can walk two blocks and
watch the glorious sunset over the Hudson
behind the Jersey hills.
And Ross is safe—no more chips—

Nov. 11/31
My dearest Boy:
. . . Ross was near a turning point, Glenn
dear; that day he came to me, two days
before he died, he said as much. 
He said
his life was "rotten" and he knew it was
all wrong. 
That was when I offered him
my bank account—every penny I owned, if
he would turn over a new leaf and begin
again. He was on the verge of doing it.
The chip filled him, you know—when he
spoke of leaving her she pounded his dear
head, or threw pillows or something at him,
and it caused a hemorrhage. The death cer-
tificate which came to me in Canada with
the ashes, says "Cause of death unknown"—
"contributory cause a mastoid 
operation."
But he had recovered from the operation.
I can see now why Ross's Doctor, the one
who operated, was so "all for me" and pro-
fessed himself anxious to go into court
against the chip.
May the Gods be good to you.
Lady M.

My dearest Boy and Girl:
Just a line to say they are too beautiful
for words. 
Perfect in every way—color,
freshness, bloom, plenty of green. 
They
actually put layers of oil paper between the
blooms to prevent their being crushed. 
I
have never seen more beautiful roses. When
Ross spent his last birthday with me—Oct.
16/29—ne carried me some roses like those.
They have always been my favorite flower,
and color; Ross knew that—he loved them
too, and so he has never given me any other
sort of flower. You are so good and kind
to think of me in this way—I appreciate it
very much.
It gave me a lot of comfort yesterday to
remember that Ross came to me on that, his
last birthday. 
He came in the afternoon,
took me to dinner and the theatre—we were
happy together. I am glad to know that he
never spent any holiday, any Holy Day, with
the Chip.
It is all difficult to understand—let me

. . . The Supt. here, in my opinion is per-

.. . One of these days I shall explain to you
my attitude toward this house—especially to
the old one in the office—the "Supt." but not
today.
I have been reading up on American
Artists—painting and sculpture—and was
especially interested to follow the work of
Sargent and Abbey in the Boston Library.
Then I go to the Museum and pick out the
things I've been reading about, and find it
very interesting.

April 15/32
My dear Boy and Girl:
Whether it's due to the infirmities of old
age—that I have become dried up and brittle,
or that my bootlegger is supplying bad stuff
—anyway, I fell, on Saturday, on the street
and fractured a rib. 
Our nurse here took
me to the hospital on Monday—at my
expense—and we had an x-ray taken—at least
they had, for we haven't heard a word from
them since. It is now 4 days. Only that my
rib hurts pretty badly I could laugh—4 days
to get an x-ray, just think of it! It's enough
to make anyone laugh.
You may take it from me, Isabel, my dear,
that one never gets anything at all for noth-
ing. We went in as charity people—the nurse
and I—I was examined by a nice young
fellow of about 23, and taken to the x-ray
dept. 
There we found 2 young girls in
white, not nurses. They got me on the table,
went thro' a number of fool motions, turned
a switch. 
We waited 20 minutes to hear
that the young moron didn't get my ribs
on the plate—I must try again. They sub-
stituted another block-head lady who again
went thro' motions measuring me, measuring
the plate, etc. We waited an hour to hear
that the plate wasn't yet dry, but they be-
lieved it showed a fractured rib! They were
to mail a statement—its now 4 days, but the
statement has not shown up. People must,
and should pay for everyhing they get—
experiences, mistakes, service, etc. 
Nature
makes no gifts.
It is, of course, very ridiculous of me to
break all my bones one by one—it would be
much simpler to step off the roof.
Best love to all.

This doesnt look like May Day—the wind
is chilly—the rain is a gloomy drizzle, and
"God's miracle of May" might be November
or anything. 
When I was a little girl my
mother—she "ran" the school—took us all
out into the country—and there on a carpet
of green velvet dotted with primroses and
violets and shamrocks we crowned 
our
"Queen of the May"—it was a great day
for us.

However "all things pass,"

But you are still young, and are on your
way to Norway—Enjoy, and make the most
of it—it will always be a glorious memory

Dont eat too much fish, or you may be-
come so intellectual you will cease to write

My dearest Travelers:
By this time you are probably "over there."
I have watched the sun set like a glory every
evening, and thought that if Heaven made
any picture so entirely beautiful as ours over
the Hudson and the Jersey hills, surely the
picture open to you must be, at least, as
grand. It gave me pleasure to know that we
were gazing at and admiring the same sun,
even if not at the same moment.
You both looked so entirely healthy and
fine when here that even if you are shaken
up a bit by old Neptune, you can stand it.
I watched your boat until the cap, and hand-
kerchief, on deck looked like a fleck of snow,
or a feather—I think everyone on the pier
was Scandinavian—they are some talkers—
and then finally the last 4 of us walked off
together. 
We all cried a bit. 
I felt very
lonely—very much alone.
Lady M.
Friday Sept. 23/32
My dearest Girl:
It was truly a splendid holiday—and you
both look so fine and well—but it is also
fine to know that you are again safe and
well at home. Even if there is a good layer
of dust on all the furniture, and one has, like
Martha, to be troubled over many things, still
it is fine to be home.
Did I tell you about the American who
bought a Scotch castle? The big hall with
its open fire-place was lovely, and supporting
the mantel was a huge flat stone on which
was carved "East or West, Hame is best."
The American looked askance at that stone,
then turning to the agent said, "Now I
don't know anything about this fellow Hame
—or if it's something to drink, but I know
there won't be any advertisements in my
house." 
And the stone came down.
Yes, "Hame is best" isn't it—it is nice to
be at home. All winter your minds will be
full of delightful pictures, and happenings,
and you will be refreshed and 
young
(younger) because of the trip.

Oct. 27/32
My dearest Boy:
I have had another experience lately. No,
not in the courts. 
One of our indigent
females came to the dining room to break-
fast a week or so ago—She was dead by
noon. It frightened me. For 3 or 4 nights
I tossed about without sleep—I, too, may
drop out suddenly—my affairs are not in
good shape. Ross's ashes was still on the top
shelf of my closet—those people here would
probably fling it into the garbage box—it
would be all my fault. I must dispose of it
myself. I went out to Pelham Bay on the
Sound, one morning, but lost my way in the
Park. I wandered around for hours, found
the Sound, but it was all fenced off by pri-
vate property—I couldn't get near it. 
I
walked, with occasional rests on fences and
door-steps, for 5 hours. It occurred to me
that if I went to Coney Island (the places
are all closed up now, you know) on a wet
day I could walk out on the pier where the
boats land and there is deep water. It rained
on Oct. 12 and 13. I put on storm rubbers,
took the ashes, and went. Rain. Rain. On
reaching the end of the pier I found 8 or 10
men fishing. The boardwalk was deserted.
There were some beachcombers on the beach,
but not many—I wandered on, intending to
select a breakwater, climb out on the stones
to deep water and then— On standing at
the rail to look around, a beachcomber—a
dirty, filthy-looking ragged 
fellow made
signs to me and pointed under the board-
walk. I actually leaned over the rail to look,
feeling sure there must be someone needing
help there, maybe dead, or dying—but alas,
no. This dirty, filthy ragged brute evidently
wanted me to go down. 
There wasn't a
policeman anywhere. Certainly I could not
now get to a breakwater. And then a man
came on the walk. I followed him—he was
a respectable looking man—wore good cloth-
ing, gloves, carried an umbrella. 
It was
growing late. 
I touched the man on the
arm, he looked at me in surprise; I said "Are
you a decent man?" 
Well, he said that
depends on what one calls decent, he tried to
be. I asked if he believed in cremation; he
said on principle he did, but his wife and
family did not, and so he supposed that he
LETTERS FROM JENNY
463
would be buried—but, he added, what dif-
ference does it make when one is dead. He
had a strong, nice voice. I told my trouble
and asked if he would stand on the beach,
hold my purse and umbrella, and protect me
from beachcombers while I climbed out on
the breakwater. He thought a while, looked
grave, and finally said Yes, if I gave my
word not to commit suicide. The stones
were very slippery—green with slime—the
tide was coming in and the waves dashed
over me, but I went on. The man shouted
what stones I should grab. It was done—
ah Ross. But I had gone out pretty far—and
it was easier to go out than get back. I
slipped badly. 
The man shouted to sit
down—for God's sake sit down. As I knew
I could not hold a footing I sat down. The
tide dashed over me. The man shouted that
I was now wet as I could be and to step
down, lift up my skirts and walk in—I did.
He walked to the station with me—
helped me wring out my jacket and skirt—
there was a quart of water in each shoe—
We shook hands—he hoped I would not get
pneumonia—but I said that people like me
do not die—a young mother with children
dependent on her would get pneumonia, but
not I. He was gentleman enough not to ask
my name, or a thing about me, nor tell his.
Now it's done, it is well.
Best love,

My dearest Girl:
It is grand to hear such good news about
our dear little man—the gods are not so bad
after all. 
He is evidently cheerful, and
active, when he is able to rig up, and run,
such a fine ship—maybe some day he may
take his poor old auntie M. along and steer
his barque to Erin's Isle; that would indeed
be a real trip and he could see and smell
primroses and violets for the first time.
One of our "ladies" went away to spend
Thanksgiving with a brother who lives in
a house on L.I. 
She tripped on the stair
carpet, fell to the bottom, broke her back, got
pneumonia on the way to the hospital, and
in 2 days was dead. 
Another, about the
same time sat at breakfast in the general
dining room, became suddenly ill, and by
noon, same day, had gone to die bourne
from whence no traveller returns. We have
many such cases here. 
Now all this has
shown me the necessity of being ready when
my call comes, it may come any day. I am
determined to place the things I love where
/ want them to be. I do not trust anyone
at all in this house. 
As time goes on I
intend to give away all my treasures—
nothing of mine belongs to this house until
after I am dead. The woman in our office,
the one I like, and trust, least in the house
had the nerve to tell me to my face one day
that she would have my "Byron" when I am
gone. Well, she is wrong—she won't. 
Not
if I have any notice of my trip at all.

My dear Isabel:
I have the distinction of having received
the first Christmas box sent to this house;
and I am trusting to your sound sense to
understand, and our friendship of so long
when I send back part of it. For a person
in my circumstances to hoard up things she
can never use would be, in my opinion,
criminal.
It is yet so early in the Xmas season—not
a tree on the streets for sale—that you have
oceans of time to send your gifts to some
friend who can use and enjoy them.
Now my real news. Today is the first of
this week that I have been at all nearly
normal. I was under dope for 3 days and
3 nights this week—I still take it every night.
For several weeks I have been annoyed by
having my feet "die"—you know that feel-
ing, almost everyone gets it once in a while.
I was not at all alarmed, altho' it was queer
to find my foot and leg go asleep while I
was out for a walk, and of course exercising
it. However, I said nothing about it. Then
one day in my room my right foot and leg,
right hand and arm, right neck and ear,
right side of rny nose, right side of my lips
and tongue all fell asleep. Alas! That eve-
ning I went to the bath, and when up to my
neck in water it started again—my toes

first—always the right side, up and up to my
lips and tongue, my right eyelid even.
The Dr. says it is all nerves—no danger,
but—I must sleep and sleep and sleep. Hence
the dope. 3 days and 3 nights. 
Today I
feel better but walk like a drunken sailor.
Do me a favor, dear, ask your Dr. what
that condition is the forerunner of. 
Is it
paralysis? My Dr. says "only nerves". Only
nerves, nothing.
You see I feared I might drown in the tub.
I couldn't grab the side, couldn't step out
because of my foot and leg—I kicked out the
stopper with my left foot and just lay there
until the thing passed. What is it?
Love to all,

. . . Have been "all nerves" since that trip
I made with Ross's ashes—used to waken at
night bathed in perspiration, feeling the
waves dash in my face, hearing the roar of
the sea—now I just sleep, and sleep, and
sleep—the "twin Sister of Death" for me.

There was a time when you sent money
to me to get a Christmas dinner, and I went
from one place to another peeping in, and
finally came away. I could not bear to go in.
It is different now. Ross is better gone, than
being here. I am glad he did not have a
child. I feel sure he would not come back,
if he had the chance. 
He had lived long
enough to know that life holds nothing
worth living for.
Feb. 6/33
My dearest Girl:
Next time Glenn and you find yourselves
in New York—even should you be as kind
as to come to my funeral—you must make a
jamboree of it, and go to Radio City. Such
a place! was there ever such a placel the
wonder of wonders—no words could describe
it. 
I went to see Arliss in "The King's
Vacation"—it was my first time to see Arliss
in 25 years. He is young as ever—gentle-
manly as ever—a perfect artist. The entire
performance was a marvel—such lights—
such colors—such music. You must certainly
go to Radio City.
A week ago today something happened to
me that placed me back in the Dr.'s hands,
and kept me asleep for 3 days and nights.
What a blessing it was that dear Glenn did
not favor my living in your town, when I
was rash enough, and maybe lonely enough,
to dream of it, for surely I would be a
nuisance to you. My "fright" came about in
this way: Every morning about 9 o'clock I
go up to the office—Infirmary—4th floor, to
get my "dope" for the next night. I am still
a sleeper. I found the office door closed, and
thinking our head nurse had a patient there,
I stood in the hallway to wait for the door
to open. Now they have on the 4th floor a
maid who is rather a queer looking woman,
I do not know her at all, but have several
times noticed her quick nervous way of doing
things—She is a sort of pantry maid, washes
dishes, etc. As I stood against the wall, this
maid was doing something at the time at the
end of the hall. Suddenly, seeing me, she
made one dart at me—threw open a room
door, and screamed "Go in, Go in" and tried
to shove me into the room. I pushed her
away and said "No, no, I won't." She
grabbed me by the shoulder to drag me into
the room, and then we had a regular fight.
I could only think she had gone suddenly
mad, and was determined not to be shut into
a room with her. I fought, and screamed,
and then the head nurse caught me in her
arms, and led me into the office. They got
water and salts—the Supt. ran in—I trembled
so that I completely lost control of my body.
After a while I gasped—"Is she mad"—
"No" said nurse, "it's the corpse"—What
corpse? Why! the dead woman. What dead
woman? 
My head swam—my heart tried
to fly out of my body—they all talked
together—were they all mad? Well, it all
ended in this—a woman had died during the
night, and men were carrying her on a litter
to the lift, where we had a mortuary on the
first floor; they would have to pass me in
the hallway, and the maid having heard that
LETTERS FROM JENNY

I suffer from heart disease feared I might
be frightened, and was determined to save
me by pushing me into a room. 
Between
laughter, and tears, and heart jumps, the Dr.
came along, and so I'm still here. Wasn't
that funny?
. . . There was a man, one day, very
hungry—he entered a restaurant and ordered
soup. 
It was terrible—he tasted it—then
dropped his spoon. The waiter stood by and
watched the man, saw he wasn't pleased, and
thinking to be sociable, rubbed his hands and
leaning over said, "It looks like rain, Sir."
Well said the man it may loo\ like rain, but
it tastes damn like dish water. Our soup is
like that now and then, and as I never eat
meat my meals are pretty slim. So I buy
eggs, and stuff myself. I feel better since
doing it. Having a conscience is a very bad
thing, and quite out of style today. Indeed
I don't know that it was ever in style.
Drop a line whenever you can—you are
always welcome.

N.Y.C. Feb. 26/33
My dearest Girl:
We have had some changes in our menage
since I wrote you. You may remember how
badly I back-bit our Supt. and disliked her.
To me she was everything contemptible and
mean—a low-born, common creature, and so,
of course, being on horseback was an over-
bearing 
tyrant. 
Personally I have had
nothing at all to do with her for a long
time—I neither asked, nor gave favors. Well,
she's gone, anyway. The Board got wise to
the lady, and let her go.
Now we have quite a different woman, in
appearance at any rate—She is much younger,
and knows how to carry her body. She is a
Canadian. I only know her to look at, so
far—her teeth protrude somewhat, and she
seems to be always smiling, and pretty much
in love with the world. I haven't much use
for perpetual smilers—this thing of "being
happy all the day" doesn't appeal to me at
all. 
Even if Fate had placed my feet in a
path of roses, I think I ought to remember
that there are a lot of other people in the
world whose lot is not at all rosy. Indeed
we do not have to look very far to find
them. We have old women in this house
who have fallen and broken their hips—they
all seem to break a hip—and who are
doomed to spend the rest of .their days in
bed. One woman has added to her broken
hip the loss of sight—she is past 80. So I
rather resent my Country-woman's joyous
appearance.

My Dearest:
Don't you ever write to the Board, or any
member of it, about this house. 
All our
troubles emanate from the Board. To report
them to themselves would never do. All our
tea and coffee (God save the mark) and all
our canned goods are bought from one mem-
ber of the Board. Would she ever believe
(or grant) that the tea wasn't fit to drink?
It is to laugh. Another Board lady tells old
Mrs. P. she will get her medicine to relieve
her heart trouble when she hands over her
Bank Book. Ye Gods!
Not feeling well last week I packed my
night bag ready to slip out and run away if
I became worse, for I am determined never
to go up to the Infirmary and be at the
mercy of their head nurse. She is not merely
"une Bete Noire." She's a d 
devil.

My dearest Boy:
. . . On the afternoon I went to the
Mikado we left the theater about 5 o'clock.
I was alone, of course, and felt I just couldn't
go back to that house with all those old, old
people—old not so much in years—(there are
several past ninety) but old in thought—old
in emotion—run to seed and decay—so I
walked from the theater, 45th Street, to
Battery Park, and sat among the bums, and
other seat warmers, to watch the sun set over
the harbor. 
And what a setting it was I
Water and sky all crimson and gold—a sight
for the Gods.
Three-fourths of the women in this house
are old maids—I think maybe that is one
reason why I am, and always will be, such
a stranger among them. 
They have no
memories. . . .

My dearest Boy:
. . . Did I tell you about the woman who
died here during the very hot weather and
she lay here in her bed, undiscovered, until
she decomposed, and the stench was terrible?
She must have been dead a wee\. Of course
they hushed it up—it did not get into the
papers at all; but are we being watched
now? I'll say we are. Their watching has
become a perfect tyranny. 
We are in the
dining room at 8 a.m. then the long-legged,
hateful, abominable, Y.W. woman, Supt.,
rushes around sometime between 9 and 10,
and checks us all up. I sit here reading—
the door open—in she rushes—she's a pain-
fully energetic, active person. "Are you all
right, Mrs. Masterson?" she repeats that 3 or
4 times. Mrs. Masterson sits like a log, not
a word out of her, not even a look. If the
long-legged active creature could hold herself
quiet long enough she might see me turn a
leaf, but not 
When she gets tired asking
questions she goes away, and then I close the

My dearest Boy:
It would have given me great pleasure to
be able to accept our dear Isabel's invitation
to help usher in your new year, and erect
another mile post. But the fact is, my money
is low—money seems to be at the bottom of
pretty nearly everything.
Sight, to me, is an absolutely essential part
in my living at all. People can live and be
blind, but not me. We have a woman up-
stairs (the Infirmary) 86, stone blind, bed-
ridden, yet she eats 3 square meals a day,
and lives on. My sight was dim, so I went
to a specialist, and got new glasses. 
Special-
ists cost real money. Then I had an Ear
specialist examine my ears—more money—
his examination was not satisfactory to me,
and so I am looking around for another. I
am not exactly deaf, for I hear sounds, but
at a lecture cannot follow every word, and
the movies are mostly a rattle and noise to
me (altho* that's not much loss, to judge by
the pictures).

My Dear:
They are perfectly lovely—perfectly fresh
and beautiful—in my opinion, a 
perfect
flower; indeed their beauty and the love and
kindness back of them did help to "brighten
the day." It will always be a day of wonder-
ment to me—even now it is difficult to
grasp—only three days before his going three
Doctors pronounced him perfectly recov-
ered—he sat in my room on the roof and
we planned his going to Chicago and turn-
ing over a new leaf, or rather 7 planned, for
he was on the fence. I gave him my Bank
Book good for several hundred dollars and
begged him to go. He was to come back on
Monday—the 3rd day—and tell me his
decision, but on Monday he lay in a coma
in the Hospital, You say I acted bravely at
that time, but it is your kindness makes you
think so; I wasn't really brave—I just didn't
realize it at all. I have often thought since
that it was a mercy I had so many enemies
to fight at that time, for I was forced into
being alert and had no time to grieve.
I feel that it is quite possible that Ross
guided me—Ross in his remorse—or my two
sisters who always cared for me—to take
what steps I did take at that time to foil the
plans of Barter and his friend the Chip.
LETTERS FROM JENNY

An old woman belonging to this floor has
been ill for several weeks and was taken to
the Infirmary, 4th floor. I did not know her
very well, but we did say "hello" now and
then. 
When the beautiful roses came on
Sunday I felt overcome by your thoughtful
kindness, and ashamed of my own attitude
in keeping so entirely aloof from those
people, so I picked out 5 lovely buds and
some green, wrapped them in the nice soft
white paper, wrote a short note wishing the
old villain a speedy recovery and took them
upstairs to a nurse. What happened then?
Why, that horrid, ignorant, old wretch
shoved them off her bed—the roses and
note—"Take them away" she cried "take the
horrid things away. She might have waited
until I was dead—throw them out." 
Now,
what do you think of that? That is a sample
of our "ladies" in this house. Guess I shall
keep in my shell.
The coffee served here mornings is just
dark-colored water, no odor, no taste—if it's
hot I feel grateful—When it is merely luke-
warm I leave it. And the tea is like lye. So
you see, my dear, I've got to have money.
When my money runs out, I go to the
roof, or a bridge.

made it up, and that helped. . . .

Sunday, March 4/34
Isabel, my dear:
It is quite evident that you have never been
an indigent, aged female, or your splendid
St. Patrick's Day box which arrived Satur-
day (March 3rd) would have been more
wisely chosen, altho' certainly not with more
kindly thought. 
Possibly you have never
lived in one room. 
This house is largely
made up of old women from 75 to 90 some-
thing; as a result it is kept unusually warm—
very uncomfortably warm for me. I nearly
faint in the dining room.
Whatever made you send me a quart of
thick tomato juice. What did you suppose
I could do with it? 
I always supposed
tomato juice was an appetiser, to be taken
before dinner, and frequently get it as such
when I go down town. It is not appetisers
we need here, it is something to eat. Yester-
day I went to a restaurant on Broadway, and
met 6 of our women, indigent females, all
having something to eat. Our meals are a
joke, or would be if we felt funny enough to
see them that way. When the weather is
severe and I cannot go out I lie awake until
3 or 4 am knowing I need food.
But could I get up to drink lukewarm
thick tomato juice, or eat very salty crackers?
If it were only plain crackers, sweet, wheat,
graham, social tea, arrow root, but salt? And
by the way, I have never seen them served
anywhere—in what way are they used. They
would probably be ok with a glass of beer if
one had no pretzels or with cold meat. Had
the sardines been in individual tins which
contain 4 or 5—I often buy them that way—
but in such a large tin! I could not eat a
whole tin at one sitting, and what could I
do with what was left? My room is so hot.
I have never eaten preserved meat of any
kind—I couldn't. And the cheese is too soft
for me.
I hope and pray you will be sensible and
understand.
Drop a line and say you're not vexed.

... I think I told you some time ago that
we had a Supt. who was nothing to brag
about, being an ignorant over-bearing indi-
vidual. 
Well, like our friend Mrs. Gamp
she kept her bottle on the mantel piece, just
to put her lips to when she "felt disposed"—
she evidently felt disposed too often for the
Board got wise to her, and the lady found
herself out of a job.
Along came her successor, and why God
ever made such a woman is a mystery to me.
But then why did he make mosquitoes, or
flies or such? This one is a very tall aggres-
sive woman—she has protruding teeth that
always make me think of "L'homme de rire,"
for I never know whether she is laughing or
not. 
But I could stand her looks—not her
manner. 
The dear lady seems to think we
are all criminals, here to be taught by her—
I was walking down the hall to the dining
room one morning—She stood down near the
door—"Come, hurry up, hurry up" she said
"the bell will ring soon." 
I might be a
puppy, or a naughty child. Needless to say
I did not hurry up, or enter the dining room
at all until after she had rung the bell and
said grace. . . .

To be so long without saying a word"
about my beautiful roses, and they were-
surely beautiful, would be unpardonable only
that I have been, and am, "not myself at all"
and at the bottom of the Slough of Despond.
Everything happened in October and Novem-
ber for me. Ross was born, and died, was
killed, then, and my sisters and brother had
to go then too. Of course you know the
Chip killed Ross—he was going to "turn over
a new leaf" and she killed him; even the
death certificate says "the immediate cause of
death is unknown." 
It may be unknown to
the Doctors, altho' I doubt it, but it is quite
clear to me.
Even Isabel's birth, and yours, in those
months do not clear up the skies for me.
But they do much—how frightful it would
be not to have you.
I sincerely hope the day may never come
when either of you may feel that life is a
curse. Last week I found a scrap of paper
in one of Ross's books, and in his writing it
read:—"He who in the midst of woes de-
sireth Life, is either a coward or insensible"
Sophocles.
I nearly went to the Bridge—roses and all.
I believe that Tom Moore has some artistic
value. That is the reason why I sent it to
you. 
Two members of our Board have
admired it, and expressed a wish to have it—
said to "leave a note in the office about it,"
well! I won't. No one in this damn prison
will ever lay a finger on anything of mine
if I can help it.

My Valentine is lovely—I had just about

then along comes my lovely "Just for you."
I think that one of the great tragedies of
life—maybe the greatest—is when one real-
izes that life has passed them by—to know
perfectly well that nothing very much can
possibly happen ever again. My countryman
was, of course, right when he sang "There's
nothing half so sweet in life as love's young
dream"—and even tho' it's only a dream, and
suffers many jolts, yet it is everything while
it lasts.
What a splendid, ignorant, natural fellow
Babe Ruth is—just as God made him—no
airs—no pretence—of course we love him,
and are glad he is back where he wants to be.
How different a man to that big-headed
Swede, Lindbergh, who thinks he knows it
all. Of course the trial was a mere fizzle,
many of us believe they have the wrong man,
and the English and Canadian comments on
the trial certainly were not complimentary to
America. Such a spectacle could not occur
in any country but America. 
Fancy the
puffed-up Swede—an ignorant fellow—and
the prosecuting Attorney, and 
presiding

My Friend:
If it were not that my recent experiences
have been so very real and so very terrible,
my treatment of you, in being silent, would
be inexcusable. 
And you, as usual, were
patient, stood by the lower dog, and gave
him ("her" this time) the benefit of the
doubt.
I must go back to April 14 when I sent my
resignation from this prison to its first direc-
tress. She called at my room on April 16,
acknowledged the letter, said she would place
it before the Board, and I would hear from
them in about two weeks. The Board meets
in this house every Thursday. 
Two weeks
went by—four—not a word. I watched them
from my window come in and out every
Thursday—they simply took no notice of me
at all. On June 3 I asked our Supt. if I
might have the use of the front elevator in
order to move out my furniture, as I intended
470

to move; she said no that the Board said I
could not move anything out, and must wait
until after their meeting on June 27.
Now the June 27 meeting is the last held
until September, there being no meetings
during July and August. 
Of course I saw
that was a bluff, they would be "too busy" to
get around to my case on June 27, and so I
must wait until Sept.
That did not strike me as being fair—
April 14 to September 5 is a long wait for
an answer to a letter. My intention was to
go to Canada, and remain there.
All went well until we reached the Inter-
national Border, Canadian side. 
The Cus-
toms men came out. Was I going to remain
in Canada, or on a visit? 
Oh, why does
anyone ever tell the truth—if some good
angel had only prompted me to lie—but
alas! I said "yes, going home to remain."
That was my Waterloo. They took me from
the train and questioned me for 2 hours.
The train went on without me. I must have
jour thousand dollars to enter even on a
visit. Needless to say I have never even seen
that amount of money. Had I any relatives
in Canada—yes, a sister; prove it—well, I
couldn't prove it right off the bat. 
The
Canadian man was an ignorant Irish Roman
Catholic—he gave me to distinctly under-
stand that I was a liar and a crook. 
I
became petrified with fright. He refused to
let me pass. Well, I got back to the Ameri-
can side—it was then / A.M.—the American
Customs man was sorry for me. He drove
me in his car to a nice hotel, clean and not
expensive—at 2 A.M. it occurred to me that
I ought to telegraph Betty (my sister) and
beg her to help me; so I went out and sent
a night letter. 
She went to the Customs
Dept. next day to see what could be done.
They wanted her to sign over some of her
property to me—she refused. She refused to
sign anything. 
In the meantime I sent an
appeal to Ottawa, showing that my husband
was born in Canada and that his Father and
relatives owned property there, and I rushed
around from one Customs man to another,
until I ached from head to toe.
After jour weeks the answer came back—
I had lived too long in America to have any
claim on Canada—that it made no difference
about my husband being born there—that I
was not in any case a Canadian, having been
born in Ireland, that I was British, not
Canadian. I could not enter.
How I ever held all the water I drank is
a mystery to me—my lips became so dry I
could not speak, and hadn't saliva enough to
moisten them. I was burning up with fever.
Well, there was nothing to do but come back.
I had spent a lot of money—the price of food
was shameful, evidently intended to hold up
tourists—it rained for a couple of weeks—
I had no umbrella.
I left on July 3 on a bus. My stars, how
they jolt one! 
It threw me around from
10 P.M. until 1:40 P.M. next day—I was sick
and sore. I stood like a fool at the Grey
Hound station and wondered where to turn.
Was there ever such a God-forsaken mortal—
and what had I ever done to deserve all
that—surely I must have done something, but
what was it?
I spent several hours in the down-town
district hunting a room—if I could only lie
down. 
But they all looked too terribly
dirty—old and dirty—better step off a bridge
than live in such dirt—yet I have photo-
graphs and more books that I love, and
should destroy before stepping off a bridge—
I must find a room—there must be one
somewhere—every room in New York can't
be dirty—I must keep on hunting. 
When
night came I staggered into a Hotel on
B'way, a very nice house. It's a wonder they
took me in—I must have looked drunken,
but the clerk was a jewel, I told him my
trouble, he said "I will give you a room near
the Bathroom—slip in and have a good warm
bath—then sleep." 
Ah! 
It cost $1.50. 
I
slept for greater part of two days. Then out
again to hunt a room up north. I found one
on I49th St. It was evening when I found
it. 
Of course there are plenty of rooms
from 5 to 10 dollars a week—nice and
clean—but how could I pay that? The first
night I itched very badly—ye Gods! 
I was
eaten alive—I spent 2 nights sitting up on a
very hard kitchen chair afraid to lie down—
I was ill—real, downright sick, body and
soul. It poured rain. I came back to the
prison. They must have felt sorry for me—
I was nearly dead—they took me in—I own
LETTERS FROM JENNY
my own bed here—it is perfectly clean—I
took a bath, and fell on the bed—what a
mercy.
Then my worry began that they might
refuse to keep me, but the "release papers"
were never signed by me and it's a question
if those people could put me out; but they
didn't try to do it—the Supt. was very kind
to me, and said she felt sorry for me.
My clothing is still in Montreal—the
Express people are slow in getting it back
(with double Express charges) my money
came back with double Exchange charges.
The Customs people talked of deporting me
to Ireland. Jerusalem! Fancy my going to
Senor De Valera and how delighted he
would be with a protestant lady.
Do you pardon me—my terrible silence—
my terrible plans that didn't carry? 
Will
write again tomorrow. When you write to
me use some sort of seal—a wafer—anything.
They open our mail.
My love, and deep gratitude to you all.
Lady M.
July 17/35
. . . Now I f^now one can rent a decent
room in Montreal for $10 a month, and the
10 I now pay for food would support me
there. And what comfort! To make a cup
of tea when one felt like it—to read at night
when one can't sleep—while here we cannot
make tea or anything, and the lights go out
at 10 o'clock. I suffer from insomnia, and
the nights are a horror. Then, in Montreal
I can meet women and men I have known
all my life, since we were young together—
here I never meet anyone I know, and am
too old to hunt up new friends.
Think of being in a city with 7 million
men and women and knowing no one. Of
course if I were a nice gossiping Christian
lady I could join some church, but—ah no!
For the W. Y. C. A. I have no use at all-
like the Y. M. C. A. they are out strictly for
money.
On reaching New York I was not only
sick and sore in body, but in soul also.
After hunting for the room among the dagos
and dirty Irish, it became evening, and I was
"all in." 
I had only a few dollars in my
pocket—the rest was in Canada—and I was
afraid to spend them. The Devil prompted
me to go to the Y. W. lodging house on i6th
St. They offered me a bed for $1.50 in a
room with another woman. 
I said "I am
tired to death—feel terrible," and the woman
said "You look it." She then shoved over a
form for me to sign. I must become a mem-
ber of the Y. W. pay 25 cents for the form,
and pay 5 cents a day extra while in the
house, to show my sympathy with the Y. W.
I said I did not want to join—I only wanted
a bed. 
Nothing doing. 
I would go to a
police station rather than encourage such
grafters, liars, and hypocrites and I said so.
Then I staggered up to the hotel, assured the
clerk I was not drun\, altho' I looked it, and
he gave me a lovely room for $1.50. 
No
religion about it—just business. No hypoc-
risy—they had a bed to sell—I rented it—
that's all.
I never intended to sponge on anyone in
Canada—I meant to live on my own money
as long as it lasted and when it was all gone
to step out of the picture. That is what I
must do here. Intend to do. And why not?
Who cares? Of what use am I to anyone on
Earth? 
This coming back to prison gives
me a chance to destroy things I love, and
meant to use in Canada. Some photographs,
and a few more books. I will "get my house
in order" without delay. 
Already the ex-
treme weariness and tension has left my
body, or nearly so—I can Mn\ once more.
Merciful Heaven, what a tremendous hold I
must have on what we call life—my Mother
must have been a healthy woman. Best love
to you all—more later. 
Lady M.
N. Y. C. Sunday Oct. 13/35
My dearest Boy:
. . . I have been around trying to hunt
up some class, or lectures, for the winter.
There are, of course, plenty, but they are all
too expensive for me. Columbia charges $15
for the Winter Extension Course, or $1.50 for
each single lecture, and when I found they
have such lecturers on their program as
Amelia Earhart, I pass them all up. 
The
very sight of the woman is disagreeable to
me. Then the Met. Museum charges $10 for
3 mos. and all their free lectures are by
women. I don't like to see women on a
472
ANONYMOUS
platform—never saw one yet I would want
to see again, and then their thin squeaky
voices give me a pain. I always feel kind
of ashamed when I see a woman stand up
to speak. Last time I went to the Met. the
woman speaker kept laughing all the time,
and heaven only knows what she saw funny
about it, for the subject was on tapestries and
their making. Women are like that.
. . . I have now no hope of getting out
of here, and so accept my fate in a stupid,
stolid manner as one would if at the bottom
of a well. This also applies to many of the
half-witted stupid old women who hang
around here for years and years—their minds
(if they ever had any) have ceased to work,
they have gone to seed.
. . . I am greatly interested in the war
and read all the papers, altho* I don't sup-
pose that any of the reports are reliable. It
seems the whole world is mad—every line of
life in every country is upset. I have now
reached the point, like the old Quaker,
twirling my thumbs, and nodding at you,
say "Except me and thee"—thee will always
stand out, and alone, to me. I would be lost
without you—I often feel that I am the lone-
liest woman in the world, but I can never
be that while I have you, and that will be
"till all friendships die."
Often I do not speak one word for weeks
at one time—it is hard to be alone.
Lady M.
N. Y. C. Oct. 30/35
My dearest Boy:
. . . Oh No! you are very kind to offer
to cover a class for me, and I'm sure you
mean it. But you see, I am not on my last
dollar yet, and to accept money from you
when I have some lying in the Bank is out
of the question.
The Prison Dec. 31/35
My dearest Girl:
What a faithful person you are—you don't
forget—and whether you care a lot for us
old fogies or not, you just hang on to us
anyway—know it would grieve us if you left.
Your letter—the last this year, reached me
an hour ago, and I nearly died laughing
about the dog, the dirty creature (don't let
Donald know I called him that). . . . I am
glad, however, that you are not going about
dragging a fool-dog, like so many of the
"ladies" do here. 
The way those "ladies"
stand watching the fool-dog make his No. I
and No. 2 on a perfectly clean sidewalk or
door-step is too disgusting for words.
. . . May the Gods be good to you in
the New Year. I can't tell you how grateful
I am to you for making the old one so
pleasant for me.

The Prison, March 10/36
My dearest Boy:
. . . One thing I intended to mention in
my last I omitted. You will doubtless be
surprised to hear that the beautiful red roses
which Isabel and you sent me last November
are still here on a shelf near the window.
When they came I placed them in a vase
with water. They remained fresh for a long
time, then, like most of us, drooped. 
I
drained off the water, and left them in the
vase—time passed—they faded and grew old
but were still loved by me. So I just handle
them very carefully—don't shake them at
all—and there they are. Now and then a
leaf falls off, but on the whole they are still
themselves, and you.
It seems to me that Nature had a miscar-
riage somehow in you, for you should have
been Irish—you have many attributes of the
Irish—many of their best points—maybe you
are like the American Irishman who said he
was Irish, but was not born in his native
country.
Lady M.
The Prison—March 26/36
My dearest Boy:
Certainly it seems that the gods, if there
are any, must be fond of green—could they
by any chance be all Irish, I wonder! But
green is pushing up its beautiful face every-
where now, in every nook and corner—I
stood on Riverside Drive yesterday, and
gloried over the Park—the Park is terraced—
LETTERS FROM JENNY
473
and to look down over the several slopes, all
tinged with green is a delight. And there
are buds, scores of them, altho* the wind is
still chilly. It seems to me there must be
something terribly wrong with anyone that
does not thrill to Spring—even I, who
snoozed and snoozed so stupidly all winter,
am almost quite awake again. . . .

The Prison Sunday April 11/36
My dearest:
. . . You can understand, I feel sure
(Betty can't, or pretends she can't) that if
and when they open and destroy any of our
letters we could never know a thing about it.
Naturally they would say such a letter never
was delivered to them by the mailman, and
who could say it was? That they want to
know about our money, or property, is
beyond a doubt. One old woman was sub-
ject to heart attacks and used to beg for a
drop of brandy, or some stimulant, and the
nurse (the Catholic dog) said she—the old
woman—might have brandy if she told what
she had done with her Bank Book. The old
woman never told. She is dead now.
Lady M.
The Prison. April 13/36
My dearest Boy:
. . . The people who are making a fuss
about the lovely green pigs are all wet. The
English had nothing to do with it at all, it
came about naturally for the pig to represent
Ireland because the Irish landlords are all
absentees—they live in England—and dieir
Irish estates are let, and sub-let, as a result
the sub-tenants seldom had enough to eat and
found it next to impossible to pay the rent—
so they all keep a pig—diey have to be careful
of him, if he got cold and died it would be a
calamity—so they keep him in the house—
the room—with themselves. Every market-
day, once a year, he is sold, and the money
goes to the landlord, so the pig is called "the
gentleman who pays the rint." Of course
all the real Irish love the pig. It is only after
the Irish become Americanized, and put on
airs, that they want to disown the pig.
Lady M.
The Prison. April 15/36
My dear Isabel:
. . . I am afraid my newspaper clippings
must be rather a nuisance to you, and I will
stop sending them if you say the word. It
won't make me angry at all. The fact is I
am hungry to death for a little human com-
panionship—if I could only turn to some
friend and ask her opinion of such and such
an article, or cartoon (I love cartoons) and
give mine, but being always alone is hell.
The old women here are just sitting around
waiting to die. I don't believe any of them
give a whoop whether fat Herbert or smiling
F.D.R. is elected, or if the "first lady" is
merely a wind-bag. And why should they?
They are all too near the end of the road
where nothing matters. 
Lady M.
The Prison. Friday. May 15/36
My dear Girl:
. . . Far be it from me to wish ill to any
poor dog, but I certainly am glad you have
decided to banish yours. To have a female
dog about the place must be horrible. I
spend most of my time these fine days down
on the Drive, and to see a fool woman
dragging along a she-dog, and all the he's
in the place running after them fills me
with disgust for both the she-dog and the
she-woman. . . . 
Lady M.
The Prison July 22/36
My dearest Boy:
. . . What of me? Oh, I have settled
down to the hopeless belief that I am doomed
to remain here—barring accident—until I
take the Law into my own hands. I speak
to no one. What can one say to a stranger
of 80 or so, whose thinking days—if she ever
had any—are long past.
In the meantime I am trying my best to
keep "right side up," heat or no heat, to keep
out of the clutches of those grafters and their
damn Catholics in the Infirmary, and hope
that if there's a God He may take pity on
me and get me out of here. But God or no
God I can of course step off the Bridge when
I get ready. People do it every day—even
the young who must have something to live
for, 
I have simply nothing at all—it is

almost a crime to go on. A great many of
the old ones in this house are more or less
"off," and I must act before reaching that
stage.
But more anon.
My best love to you as of yore.
Lady M.
The Prison. Sept. 4/36
My dearest Girl:
. . . I have taken several trips to the sea—
always quite alone—and while I truly love
the sea the coming back—always alone—'
makes me feel pretty desolate. It's a terrible
thing to be old and be alone—as to finding
friendship or even companionship in this
prison, it is quite out of the question. There
is one old woman who knocks timidly at
my door every day, and when I open she
wrings her hands in apparent despair, she
has mistaken my room for another, or says
she has—she is "off" of course. Then they
are almost all deformed in some way—many
of them on crutches, or hobbling along with
canes. We have one old woman of 94. She
hardly seems human—all skin and bone, and
as they never go out except to the A & P
across the street for something to eat, and
never read anything except the murders in
the newspaper, what in the world could one
talk to them about? I seldom open my lips
to anyone. Fortunately I love books, and
there is a fine public library quite near, and
I who rather despise women on the platform,
haven't a bit of use for our "first lady," or
Miss Perkins, or the fool-widow who roped
in the Dane (her third) find real pleasure in
our old time books—our George Eliot—
Bronte—Jane Austen etc. and the French
writers. 
I have just finished "Of human
bondage" by Maugham, and was delighted
with it because it shows the futility of life.
Maybe you've read it. Of course no woman's
life is futile if she has a child. . . .

My dearest Boy:
. . . Of course it may never be necessary
to trouble you about the cremation at all.

Lady M.
The Prison October 12/36
My dearest Girl:
. . . If I had a daughter I would advise
her to marry—marry somebody—anybody—
only marry—just to prove that it means
nothing. The ordinary "old maid" the good
moral ones—if there are any such, merely
suffer from sex frustration. 
Sex plays a
larger part in life than we are willing to give
it credit for. One of our old maids during
the summer when men worked in the garden
got out on the fire escape to blow them kisses
and smile at them. One tripped on the stairs
and fell, I picked her up, and we spoke for
a few minutes—her voice has grown high
and squeaky—I asked her name, she gave
some name, I glanced at the wedding ring
she wore, and said "Mrs."? 
She then ex-
plained she had never married, and wore her
deceased mother's ring as a protection. 
I
asked from what did it protect her, and she
said "Oh the men." 
She then went on to
say that men thought twice before insulting
her if they thought she had a husband. Ye
Gods! 
I looked at this extremely plain,
unattractive old creature and felt pity. We
have now one old soul who, like myself,
hates this prison and is deathly afraid of the
damn Catholic nurse they have in the
Infirmary—she is always running away.
Well, that's the way—there is nothing in
life worth living for except money, and one
must find that while they are young. If one
is so ridiculous as to slip into old age without
money one must put up with being crowded
into insanity, or "take arms against a sea of
troubles, and by opposing, end them."
This isn't a very cheerful Birthday letter to
send anyone, but it is all dead true. Save
your money, my dear, now while you are
young—that's the text. . . .

his gloves and ties—I could only manage a
few at a time—but now it is a relief to know
that those dogs here can never even set eyes

Let me send you my carton of books. Oh,

be merciful to an unfortunate old woman
who loves her few books—gifts from Ross

If I ever get out of this damn

My dearest Boy and Girl:
. . . The roses are lovely—never saw any
lovelier—the room is full of their fragrance.
I do not believe in immortality, but if I did
I believe Ross would feel grateful to you.
He and I were too close together for many
years to be separated permanently by a chip.
It is only genuine things that remain. 
I
believe Ross had begun to realize that, and
that is why the chip killed him. She prob-
ably did not intend to kill him, but was
carried away in anger when she felt that she
had lost him.
What a strange muddle life is, and why
must we go through it anyway—of what use
is it?
Your roses—your thoughtfulness and kind-
ness were the only bright spot in my exceed-
ingly dark day, but they were much—thank
you sincerely.

The Prison November 24/36
My dearest Girl:
. . . I have decided not to sleep all of this
winter, as I did last—better die at once. So
I've started my study of Grecian history all
over again. I've always been a strong ad-
mirer of the Greeks—their wars—dramas—
literature and art. This history I'm on now
starts off on the Hellenes, but that is far
enough back for me. Ross gloried in Greek
sculpture—many a day when in Chicago I've
carried him thro' the Art Galleries on my
back—his drawings were later hung at the
students' exhibition—he attended the school
there. The Art Institute in Chicago is, in
my opinion, much more beauiful than the
Metropolitan here.
I intend to go to the Metropolitan often
this winter—they have lectures, and "gallery
talks" almost every day. My reason for not
going more last winter is because they are
mostly delivered by women, and I don't
believe Nature ever intended women for that
purpose. They grin and laugh too much—I
can't bear "smilers"; we have dozens of them
here in this prison—what they find to go
about grinning at is a mystery to me.

My dearest Girl:
What a perfectly lovely shirtwaist—it came
yesterday—you might have heard my "oh"
of surprise, there. It is my taste exactly; and
the strange part is that it's a perfect fit.
Because of my gorilla-like long arms I have
always had to buy my shirtwaists too large,
otherwise the sleeve would be up to my
elbow, but this one is just right.
I went out early on Christmas morning,
soon as the prison doors were unlocked, and
stayed out all day. The Christmas Show at
Radio City was just about perfect, all except
the admission price—it always makes me sore
to see the prices raised on the very day when
men want to take their children, family and
friends to the greatest thing in the show line
that can be produced. If those grafters were
really Christ-like they would lower the prices
so the whole family could enjoy it. It must
be terrible for a father to have to leave out
little Johnny or May because he had come to
the end of his dollars. No wonder men steal.
I was alone all day—never opened my lips
to a soul.

Well, this is fine to be in touch with you

long without hearing from you before, but
could always picture you moving about the

where you were—awful!
We, in the prison, are as usual—the black
bow is again on the front door today, and
that means another $500 for the grafters. I
hope they give the old woman something to

Thank you so much for those splendid
postals you sent me—they are fine. It is
grand to know that you are having such a
wonderful trip. 
The flowers—so called—
came all safe and sound—I am wondering
what put it into your head to send them to
me. You had evidently forgotten that I am
in a prison and have only one cell which
faces north west; about 3 every afternoon
the sun—when we have any, gets around to
my one window. 
At the present time we
have little or no sun because it rains every
day, and the first essential called for by the
"flowers" is sun. 
Of course you did not
suppose that they are something new—we
had them when I was young, in Canada—
Mother was always fussing around with any-
thing that looked like a flower. A peddler
sells them on Broadway almost any day that
it's fine enough to stand out-doors.
We are not allowed to put anything on our
window sills—thank Goodness—if all those
ex-servant girls and other common trash got
out their eggs and butter on the windows we
would be a fine looking sight—so where am
I to get the sun for the flowers? My one
window is never closed—I'm a fresh air, and

the poor flowers have simply no show at

it was passed around again she had written
on it "This is a canary"—I think I cried.
. . . Now be sure and get drunk—good
and properly drunk—on St. Patrick's Day,
and make your dear mother and Isabel get a
jag on.
My best love to you,

My dearest:
The Hoodoo got me. I fell with consider-
able force down the subway steps at Times
Square—the steps are metal—and broke a
couple of small bones in my foot. 
I was
taken to the Hospital for an x ray and am
now in a plaster cast. Slept all the time for
3 days and nights—feel better now—seems
every nerve, muscle, and cord in my body
was dragged and strained—am feeling much
better now. More later.

My dearest:
. . . They took me down to the Hospital
yesterday—a terrible ordeal. The clinic was
crowded with all the down and outs black
and white. The "boys" merely glanced at
me and said to go back in a week. If I were
a free lady I would call in a regular Dr. and
have him take me to a regular hospital, but
the grafters would not permit a regular Dr.
to enter this house. We must have theirs, or
none. T was afraid to leave the book in my
room when going out yesterday—knew they
are dying to see it. Examine the envelope
and see if you think it was tampered with.
I am at their mercy.

My dearest:
I am not feeling so very well—they said I
must eat more—I was so weak. I ate more.
I bought port wine with your dollar, and am
now on a second bottle—it is helping me.
We go on Tuesday to have my foot and leg
"baked"—it's an ordeal—I may drop out—
am taking strychnine to brace my heart.
Sorry I could not arrange about the crema-
tion in time. . . . Get cheapest coffin made,
no flowers, no minister, no coach. They may
need consent of my nearest blood relation;
Betty knows about my desire for cremation.
Fight for cremation, dear—don't let them put
me up in Woodlawn. I have no close rela-
tive anywhere but Betty. It is you I trust to
protect me. Am not yet well enough to use

My dearest Boy and Girl:
Hurrah! pen and ink once more altho"
pretty shaky, but first attempt must be to
you.
I think my progress is satisfactory—cannot
use my foot yet—but am learning like a
baby with the aid of a stout cane. Am hope-
ful of making great strides this week. 
At
present I am bandaged with olive-oil and
straps.
Cannot tell you much yet because I am
unable to mail my own letters.

My dear Donald:
Thank you so much for that perfectly
lovely card you were kind enough to send
me. It fitted in so well with my case that it
might have been printed for me.
I am not yet "stepping out" as I used to
do but I am a long way on the road to mend.
I am delighted to hear that you are again
quite close to, and I am sure enjoying, my
beloved sea. King Neptune and you are, of
course, strong friends—I love him too.
Your little "poem" about the sea gulls is
fine—I have put it in my treasure box, as I
suppose it's your first attempt in that line.
My treasure box holds the telegram which
your dear Father sent me when the Fairies
brought you to us. It also holds the lace
handkerchief which your dear Mother wore
on the day she was married. It is indeed a
treasure box.
This is my first day out on the street—
will write more soon. Am still very nervous.

My Dearest and Best:
I have been a very sick lady, in body and
mind. Am not yet quite out of the woods,
but am on the track to mend. This will be
the first of a scries of tales of my experience
with those infernal hypocrites and liars, and
double dealers, the damn Catholics, and the
equally damn Y.W.C.A. I dared not tell you
much while I was ill because I could never
mail my own letters, and of course those
dogs opened them.
I was indeed in a bad fix when I found
myself at the mercy of those dogs. 
The
Y.W. one wanted me sent up to the In-
firmary—I asked 
the nurse 
"why"—she
whispered "I suppose she wants to hunt for
something in your room." That of course
means a Bank Book—letters, or money. 
I
begged the nurse to fight against it, and
swore there was nothing at all for the dog
to find in my room. You would have felt
sorry for me had you seen me drag myself
along—plaster cast and all—in the middle
of the night to rip from the mattress the $30
I had hidden there—you remember! 
Right
well I knew that if the nurse found it, it was
lost to me. Everyone in the house knows
she steals every cent she can lay her hands on.
Well, one night—past midnight—I lay in
a stupor—my room is never dark because of
the saloon across the way—I felt a hand steal
under the sheet and feel by breasts, neck and
back—I was petrified with fright—my foot
was in the cast—I was in pain from head to
toe—but I struck out hard as I could—
pounded her breasts—her head and face—
called her a damn dog and other fancy
names—and what do you think but she just
stole quietly away—slipped out and never
said a word. 
It was the nurse, of course,
searching for a bank book or whatever I had
hidden. 
Next morning I apologized and
hoped I hadn't hurt her very much—I asked
what she wanted, and she said "Just to see
if I was warm enough." Oh yeah!
I may not mail what I write tomorrow,
but will keep on "confessing"—there's a lot
more to tell. Oh! those damn philanthropists
and damn "Christians"—how I hate them.
Am tired, but don't I write well?

The Prison—Sunday June 27
My dearest Girl:
Soon as I opened your box yesterday and
got a good whiff of those glorious pink roses
I immediately flew away from New York
with its great brick houses like packing cases,
and landed in Newtown Park, Ireland. My
Mother's sister had a lovely house in New-
town Park, a Dublin suburb—we Gove kids
spent a good deal of time there. The house
was covered with roses—we drew them into
our bedroom windows in the early morn-
ing—the dew fresh on them, like pearls.
The house was filled with perfume. My love
has always been the red rose—but nothing in
the world could be more fragrant than those
pink roses. . . .

My dearest Boy:
. . . Betty writes me once in a while but
she has the faculty of writing a letter and
saying nothing. But I don't care now—I am
practically dead, and to step off the Bridge
should not mean much to me. . . .

The Prison—August 5/37
My Dearest and Best:
. . . Yes, I can hobble along now pretty
well, but only for a very short distance at a
time. I "give out" after 2 or 3 blocks and
just must sit down. I think, however, that
is more due to general weakness than par-
ticularly to my foot—I was a very sick lady
for several weeks and have not yet fully
recovered.
At the present time I do nothing but sleep,
drop off to sleep every time I sit down, but
I never see anyone and my life (if it can be
called life) is terribly monotonous.

The Prison. Aug. 26/37
My dearest Boy:
Rain—rain, nothing but rain—not a ray of
sunshine for days at a time. As for me, it
is hell—after two days continuous cold rain
I was nearly starved to death; my daily half
potato left me empty as a sack, and I actually
cried for something real to eat. So I just
determined to go out and get it regardless of
the consequences, so out I went. It was that
terrible kind of rain that came down with
great force and then splashed back. Well, I
went anyway—did not even carry an um-
brella, what was the use? and could not
wear a rubber on my bandaged foot. I got
coffee—red 
hot—3 cups, and 
two 
eggs.
Gypsy Lee had nothing on me. 
I stood
beside my bed and stripped—Every rag on
my back was wet, and I rung out the rain
from the bandage on my foot and leg. 
I
am still stiff from the effects—I suppose cold.
The long days—shut up alone—are pretty
long—I never speak to anyone—what can
one say to old women of 90, and many of
them "off"?
There are two at the table with me—one
94 whose false teeth sometimes get upside
down, but she eats along anyway—I try not
to stare at her; and another past 80 who
hasn't any teeth at all and has her troubles
trying to eat. After one says it's raining (and
any fool can see it is) there is nothing more
to say. I read a good deal—the old books—
classics—the new make me feel nauseated—
we have sex crimes enough in the news-
papers. I'm a great old newspaper reader—
am alarmed about our friend F.D.R. losing
ground—am disgusted about the way the
grafters have put Jimmy Walker back so he
can steal some more from the fool tax-payer
and get a pension—it certainly is a shame—
a disgrace to the country. But then Uncle
Sam loves grafters.
I seldom write to anyone. My sister Betty
being one of the gifted who can write a
letter and say nothing, I do not answer at
all (there is nothing to answer) unless she
sends me a cheque. She hates me, of course
(she is a good Christian) but fortunately
there is no love lost.
I am doing my best (with wine, eggs,
etc.) to become strong enough to walk to the
Bridge.

My dearest Boy:
My dear, no matter how crowded you may
be with duties and work, never let me slip
entirely out of your life and interests. You
have been wonderful to me—I wish I could
express how greatly I appreciate it all, and
how grateful I am to you. Without you I
would be lost and indeed alone. I will try
not to bother you too terribly with my little
woes, but you are always with me, and I
"talk" to you by the hour. . . .

The Prison Sunday Oct. 3
My dear Girl:
That was a grand treat—to hear from both
of you so soon from the new house, and to
know that you have braced up and survived
all the inconveniences and worries of the
move, and are feeling pretty well.
When mail comes to this prison it is
handed in in a bundle to the office, and then
is sorted over and examined by the Catholic
dog and the Y.W.C.A. ditto. Sometimes, to
judge by postmarks my letters are 3 or 4
days old before coming to me. 
I have
always believed (and am not alone in the
belief) that many letters are tampered with,
but we have no redress—to complain would
be foolish, as of course they would deny
delaying anything, and how could we prove
anything? 
Indeed if they marked a letter
too badly, all they have to do is pitch it in
the furnace, and we could never know that
it had come at all.
. . . Now don't wor\ too hard, take
things easy for a while.
My Best love,
Lady M.

Telegram received October 25, 1937:
MRS MASTERSON DIED SUDDENLY
GET IN TOUCH WITH US AT ONCE
ABOUT FUNERAL
SUPERINTENDENT
At the funeral Glenn was the only
mourner present, though the superin-
tendent and a few inmates of the home
attended. 
Cremation followed.
Death had overtaken Jenny suddenly,
at the door of the dining room of the
Home. While entering she fell dead—
as she had often predicted she would.
From the superintendent's account she
had become unbearably difficult. 
In
recent months she had always turned
her face to the wall if she encountered
any member of the Home in the cor-
ridor; had taken to sweeping her dinner
onto the floor from the dining room
table if it displeased her; and had even
attacked one of the inmates, hitting her
over the head with a pail. Since every-
one was afraid of her—and with reason
—the Board had been considering her
removal to an institution for the insane.
